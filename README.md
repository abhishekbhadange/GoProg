Go programs for matrix operations

The project focuses on Go programming and evaluation. There are total four Go programs for carrying out square matrix 
addition and multiplication using two different methods, namely static work division and recursive divide and conquer. The 
programs take two inputs: the number of splits (i.e. the number of pieces into which to split the matrices) and the size of 
the square matrix. Finally, evaluation is done by giving a large size for the square matrix and noting the execution times 
for different number of splits.
